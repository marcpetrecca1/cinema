# movies-app
Develop movies app using any public API that you prefer.
<br>
The home page should contain a list of the latest movies available.
<br>
Implement pagination feature on the home page for example: display an initial list of 5 movies, on clicking show more load 5 more moviesâ€¦
<br>
The home page should contain a search bar, on searching you should hide the current movies list & display the search results
<br>
When clicking on any movie on the home page it should redirect to the movie details page where you display some basic info about the movie like genres, name, release date, etcâ€¦
<br>
Donâ€™t put too much effort into the UI design.
<br>
Create a new branch from main branch then start building ðŸ› 
<br>
Good Luck!
