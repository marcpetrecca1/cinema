# movies-app
Develop movies app using any public API that you prefer.
<br>
The home page should contain a list of the latest movies available.
<br>
Implement pagination feature on the home page for example: display an initial list of 5 movies, on clicking show more load 5 more moviesâ€¦
<br>
The home page should contain a search bar, on searching you should hide the current movies list & display the search results
<br>
When clicking on any movie on the home page it should redirect to the movie details page where you display some basic info about the movie like genres, name, release date, etcâ€¦
<br>
Donâ€™t put too much effort into the UI design.
<br>
Create a new branch from main branch then start building ðŸ› 
<br>
Good Luck!


**Home Page:**

Should contain a list of the latest movies available (5 items only)

Should contain a view more button (pagination), on clicking this button it should show more items on the list

When clicking on any movie card it should redirect to the movie details page

**Search Bar:**

The search bar itself should be displayed only on the home page

When starting to type on the search bar it should hide the original list & display the search results "You can use loading indicator while fetching data"

If the user clears the search bar you should display the original list of movies again

**Movie Details:**

Should display movie details like name, genres, release date, etc...

**Theme Switcher**

The app should contain a theme switcher button "floating action button" that is displayed across all pages

When clicking this button it should change the background of the app "if it's white switch it to grey & vice versa"


**BONUS:**

Convert app to TypeScript

Connect to multiple APIs
