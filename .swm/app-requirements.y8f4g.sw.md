*   When clicking on any movie card it should redirect to the movie details page
    

## Search Bar:

*   The search bar itself should be displayed only on the home page
    
*   When starting to type on the search bar it should hide the original list & display the search results "You can use loading indicator while fetching data"
    
*   If the user clears the search bar you should display the original list of movies again
